SimpleWebKit ToDo
=================

The code probably needs reindenting to fit in the GNUstep coding style. ;-)

High Prio:
- make it clear stall after successfully loading <script language="JavaScript" src="source.js" type="text/javascript"> 
- <frame> and scrollers should work correctly
- <table> elements should really work
- <form> works (buttons and text fields interact)
- redisplay issues

HTML parsing and error robustness:
- better handle <tbody> tag (auto-insert into DOM like <body>)
- how should we parse "<h1>xxx <h2> xxx </h1> z </h2>"?
	(a) all h tags on same level (ignoring the bad </h1>) -> "<h1>xxx </h1><h2> xxx  z </h2>"
	(b) nested? -> "<h1>xxx <h2> xxx </h2></h1> z "
- maybe, we should add + (BOOL) _nested; as a separate hint to DOMHTMLElement
- simply ignore <body> in <body><frameset>...</frameset></body>
- should we accept entities in quoted paramters or not? Is this standard or not?
  like this: <input type="submit" value="&nbsp;&nbsp;Go&nbsp;&nbsp;"> from http://pda.leo.org/
- how do we handle abc<p>def</p> - we should treat any text before the first <p> as an independent paragraph without explicit formatting
- fix error handling if it is known that there is no more data coming from the source
- really handle stall and clear for loading script files and @import styles

Text Formatting/Typesetting:
- color does only understand #rrggbb and no plain text names
- <table> does not handle colspan, rowspan
- handle <pre>

- handle <p align="center"> as on http://carduus.chanet.de/ - note: it is the FIRST <p> element that suppresses to start with \n

View:
- <frame> not tested if it loads and displays subframes
- <iframe> should display a WebFrameView as NSTextAttachmentCell
- <select> should display a NSTableView as NSTextAttachmentCell

Forms:
- <input type="radio" name="group"> does not yet have radio behaviour
- if none is defined as CHECKED, it should select the first one
- <form> does not yet send anything (should build a "POST" NSURLRequest)
- <input> does not respond to mouse clicks

JavaScript:
- complete parser and evaluator
- add execution context ("this", global variables, document/event/etc.)
- add prototype objects Array, Number, Object, String, etc. with their methods
- connect to the DOMHTMLTree (via -[WebView webscriptObject])
- handle triggers like <body onload="..."> or <... onmouse="...">

Others:
- (DOMText *) splitText: what is the semantics?
- innerHTML and outerHTML do not really return html (needs generating entities)

Feature requests:
- CSS & full formatting attributes
- attributedString for text lists <li>, <ol>, <ul>, <dd> etc. is not implemented
- <textarea>, <select>/<option> not completely implemented
- history not fully implemented
- go back&forth not fully implemented (how do we cache the pages, DOMTrees etc.?
	Or do we reload/reparse everything and just keep a history of visited URLRequests?
	We should also remember scroller position(s)
	We should cache pages in NSURLCache
	We must also remember contents of <form> elements (even passwords!)
- link color definition by <body> and if link was visited recently (history)
- handle <hr> styles

mySTEP's extension requests:
- NSURLConnection needs:
  - cookies
  - cache
  - https (using NSSocket(Input|Output)Stream)
  - sending / POST&GET methods
  - header compression
  - server redirection
- NSTextTable is not rendered

GNUstep's NSURLConnection:
- NSTextTable is missing
